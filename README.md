# employee-visitor-pattern-demo

Requirements

Using the Visitor design pattern, please implement a simple program to compute the sum of all employees’ salaries. We will assume that we have 3 types of employees:
	•	fixed salary
	•	commission based only (commission rate and sale volume)
	•	mixture of both (fixed + commission)

By implementing a second visitor, please output on the console, in a JSON format, all the employee’s attributes.
